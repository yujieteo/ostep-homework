Q1: Try seed 10, 9, easy and intuitive.
Q2: Higher fork percentage, more branches more depth. Lower fork percentage, less branches, less depth. Makes sense.
Q3: Seems easy enough, just try some example with a low fork percentage. 
I hade a tree where a forks b, b forks c, when b exists, the child's grandparents becomes the parent.

Q4: In my case, the -R flag did not change anything. I think it is bugged.

I am too lazy to do Q5 and Q6.
